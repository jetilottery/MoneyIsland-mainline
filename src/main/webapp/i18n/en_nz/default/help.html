	<h3>Ticket Cost</h3>
	<p>Displays the current ticket cost.</p>
	<p>Press the left arrow (–) to decrease the ticket cost.</p>

	<h2 id="howToPlay">How to Play</h2>
	<p>Select eight out of sixteen chests to reveal prize amounts or Bonus symbols. Reveal a prize to win that amount instantly!</p>
	<p><strong>Cannon Bonus</strong></p>
	<p>Reveal three Cannon symbols to trigger the Cannon Bonus. Select a ship to reveal either a prize amount, a multiplier, or a Collect symbol. The prize amounts are totaled at the end of the bonus and multiplied by the final multiplier value. Reveal a Collect symbol to end the bonus. </p>
	<p><strong>Island Bonus</strong></p>
	<p>Reveal three Ship symbols to trigger the Island Bonus. There are five treasure maps in the bonus, each with increasing prize values. Select two of the nine map locations to reveal coin amounts. If the number of coins meets the Coins to Unlock Treasure amount for that island, the ship advances to the next island. Each island requires an increasing number of coins to advance and is dependant on the prize offered. Continue advancing to the next island until the required number of coins for the current island is not collected, or the fifth island’s prize is awarded.</p>
	<p>Only the highest prize from the last island completed is awarded.</p>
	<p>The prize and coins threshold associated with each island can differ between bonus games.</p>
	<p>Coins are collected cumulatively through the bonus.</p>
